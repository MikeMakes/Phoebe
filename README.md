# Phoebe
I am Phoebe, an amphibian vehicle developed by students from the University of Seville.

The concept is a tele-operated airboat like vehicle with a raspberry pi as brain controled from a pc through Ad-Hoc wifi.

This was an one trimester class project that is alredy finished and abandoned but what you see is functional and there are somethings that even work well. 100% FREE SOFTWARE take whatever u want; if you do so, I would apreciatte a link to your project just for the sake of curiosity.

A full in detail doc (in spanish) can be found as doc.pdf. 
Here it comes a brief description of all parts involved.
